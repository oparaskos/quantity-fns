# ‚öñÔ∏è Quantity Functions <!-- omit in toc -->
This library aims to provide a set of functions and utilities for conversion between units of mass, volume, and energy.

At this early stage it is still missing many features and units (See [Notice](#notice)).

Please feel free to fork and raise a pull request to add functionailty you deem widely useful within this domain (See [Contributions](#contributions)).

## üèÅ Getting Started

The below examples are given in TypeScript, but should be easily adapted to JavaScript. TypeScript definitions are bundled with the package.

### Installation
The library is available as an npm package. To install a package run:

```bash
npm install quantity-fns --save
# or with yarn
yarn add quantity-fns
```

### Usage

#### Converting from kilos into grams
```typescript
import { convert as convertMass } from "quantity-fns/mass"
convertMass({
    unit: 'kg',
    quantity: 10,
    type: 'mass'
}, 'g') // === {unit: 'g', quantity: 10000}
```

#### Converting from Millilitres to Litres
```typescript
import { convert as convertVolume } from "quantity-fns/volume"
convertVolume({
    unit: 'ml',
    quantity: 10,
    type: 'volume'
}, 'L') // === {unit: 'L', quantity: 10000}
```

#### Calculating the mass of 1L of water
```typescript
import { volumeToMass } from "quantity-fns/volume"
import { DensityOf } from "quantity-fns/density";
volumeToMass({
    unit: 'ml',
    quantity: 100,
    type: 'volume'
}, DensityOf.Water /*, "g"*/) // === {quantity: 100, unit: "g", type: "mass"}
```

#### Convert from Joules to Kilocalories
```typescript
import { convert as convertEnergy } from "quantity-fns/energy"
convertEnergy({
    unit: 'J',
    quantity: 100,
    type: 'energy'
}, 'kcal') // === { quantity: 0.02390057361376673, unit: 'kcal', type: 'energy' }
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Building
The library is written with TypeScript, and uses the Mocha and chai frameworks. It has no dependencies save for the scant development dependencies.

The unit tests are using the Chai assertion framework.

```bash
# Clone the project using git
git clone git@github.com:oparaskos/quantity-fns.git
cd quantity-fns
npm i # Install the dev dependencies
# Run the tests using mocha, with ts-node
npm run test
# Produce the `dist/` folder containing javascript
npm run build
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

At this early stage this library cannot be garunteed to be as accurate as needed for many use cases, there may exist flaws and issues inherent to any software project which are not tested against. For this reason libraries such as this one may not be suitable for mission critical applications such as medical devices.

If you do decide to use this library in such applications please be thorough in your testing.

However in the interest of developing this further you may wish to open a pull request against this library to test, prove and improve the accuracy of the results. This kind of contribution is greatly appreciated (See [Contributions](#contributions)).
